Each level is made up of several puzzles that use the same letters, numbers or punctuation marks.  The goal of each puzzle is move Beetle Boy through as many stars as possible before arriving at the planet.  To move to a star, press the key shown on that star.  Beetle Boy can only move to a star that is connected directly to him by a line.  A puzzle ends when Beetle Boy reaches the planet, or when he finds himself stuck with no stars he can move to.
